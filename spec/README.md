# Devcontainer CLI (Rust) â€“ Spec Index

## Purpose
- Capture the product and technical specification for a Rust implementation of the Devcontainer CLI (parity with <https://github.com/devcontainers/cli>)
- Serve as a living source of truth for feature planning, architecture, and execution milestones

## Documents
- [00-overview.md](00-overview.md): Context, goals, requirements, and success metrics
- [01-command-surface.md](01-command-surface.md): Command-line UX and behavioural details for each subcommand
- [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md): Architectural blueprint, module boundaries, and technical decisions

## Maintenance
- Keep specs updated whenever user-facing behaviour or architectural decisions change
- Treat `doc/spec` as authoritative for documentation-first development and code reviews
